Introduction:

In the realm of e-commerce, understanding customer behavior is paramount for businesses striving to enhance their operational strategies and boost customer retention. The dataset at hand encapsulates a rich tapestry of customer transactions, spanning diverse attributes such as age, gender, location, membership level, and purchase history. This case study delves into the dynamic landscape of e-commerce customer behavior analysis, leveraging advanced analytics techniques.

This comprehensive data analysis journey begins with the utilization of Talend Data Integration, a powerful tool for joining datasets. Through the integration of customer churn and customer behavior datasets, a tMap component is employed to facilitate the merging process based on the 'CustomerID' column. This strategic integration lays the foundation for a more holistic understanding of customer interactions and transactions within an e-commerce platform.

Following the dataset integration, the focus shifts to data modification using Talend Data Preparation. The objective is to standardize categorical values within the 'Gender' and 'Churn' columns. In the 'Gender' column, the four categories (M, F, Male, Female) are harmonized to represent 'Male' and 'Female.' Similarly, in the 'Churn' column, the disparate categories (0, 1, No, Yes) are standardized to 'No' and 'Yes.' This standardization ensures consistency and facilitates more meaningful analysis.

Subsequently, the analysis transitions to SAS Enterprise Miner, where the imported dataset undergoes preprocessing. This step involves handling missing values and specifying variable roles, setting the stage for robust analysis. The subsequent phases encompass Decision Tree Analysis and the application of Ensemble Methods, specifically Bagging and Boosting using the Random Forest algorithm as an illustrative example of Bagging.

Objective:

The objective of this case study is to leverage advanced analytics techniques to gain meaningful insights into e-commerce customer behavior. Through a meticulous data analysis journey, we aim to enhance operational strategies and bolster customer retention for businesses operating in the e-commerce domain.
